{"name":"ROAD","tagline":"Reader Of Appliance Display","body":"### ROAD - Reader Of Appliance Display.\r\nThis is an OCR reader based on OpenCV and Tesseract. It can be used for recognizing 7-segment digits on the LCD/LED display, such as calculator and electric meter. After detecting the text, this app will speak out the text.\r\n\r\nThis app is being developed as a mini-project for fifth semester of MCA course of [Pondicherry University](http://www.pondiuni.edu.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. K. S. Kuppusamy](http://www.pondiuni.edu.in/profile/dr-ks-kuppusamy). \r\n\r\n\r\nCompared with normal image, the LCD screen has a lower contrast and special processing solution is quite necessary for successful recognition.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This project is not complete yet.\r\n\r\nThe OCR process has three main steps:\r\n1) \r\n2) \r\n3) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@kk5190 and Santu\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you wan to give feedback or have any suggestion to improve this project eamil at kk5190krrish[at]gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
